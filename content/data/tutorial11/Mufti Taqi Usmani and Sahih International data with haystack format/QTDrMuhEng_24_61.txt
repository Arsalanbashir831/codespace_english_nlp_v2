No sin on you whether you eat together or apart. But when you enter the houses, greet one another with a greeting from Allah (i.e. say: Úáíßã As-Salamu Alaikum - peace be on you) blessed and good. Thus Allah makes clear the Ayat (these Verses or your religious symbols and signs, etc.) to you that you may understand.', 'meta': {'translator': 'Dr Mohsin Khan', 'surah_id': 24, 'ayah_no': 61, 'surah_name_en': 'An-Noor (The Light)', 'surah_name_ar': 'النور'}}
