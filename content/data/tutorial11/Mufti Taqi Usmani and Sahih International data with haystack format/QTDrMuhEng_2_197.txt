So whosoever intends to perform Hajj therein by assuming Ihram), then he should not have sexual relations (with his wife), nor commit sin, nor dispute unjustly during the Hajj. And whatever good you do, (be sure) Allah knows it. And take a provision (with you) for the journey, but the best provision is At-Taqwa (piety, righteousness, etc.). So fear Me, O men of understanding!', 'meta': {'translator': 'Dr Mohsin Khan', 'surah_id': 2, 'ayah_no': 197, 'surah_name_en': 'Al-Baqara (The Cow)', 'surah_name_ar': 'البقرۃ'}}
