{'text': 'Have you not thought about the group of the Children of Israel after (the time of) Musa (Moses)? When they said to a Prophet of theirs, "Appoint for us a king and we will fight in Allahs Way." He said, "Would you then refrain from fighting, if fighting was prescribed for you?" They said, "Why should we not fight in Allahs Way while we have been driven out of our homes and our children (families have been taken as captives)?" But when fighting was ordered for them, they turned away, all except a few of them. And Allah is All-Aware of the Zalimoon (polytheists and wrong-doers).', 'meta': {'translator': 'Dr Mohsin Khan', 'surah_id': 2, 'ayah_no': 246, 'surah_name_en': 'Al-Baqara (The Cow)', 'surah_name_ar': 'البقرۃ'}}
