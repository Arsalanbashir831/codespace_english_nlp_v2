We preferred some to others; to some of them Allah spoke (directly); others He raised to degrees (of honour); and to Iesa (Jesus), the son of Maryam (Mary), We gave clear proofs and evidences, and supported him with Rooh-ul-Qudus (Jibrael (Gabriel)). If Allah had willed, succeeding generations would not have fought against each other, after clear Verses of Allah had come to them, but they differed - some of them believed and others disbelieved. If Allah had willed, they would not have fought against one another, but Allah does what He likes.', 'meta': {'translator': 'Dr Mohsin Khan', 'surah_id': 2, 'ayah_no': 253, 'surah_name_en': 'Al-Baqara (The Cow)', 'surah_name_ar': 'البقرۃ'}}
