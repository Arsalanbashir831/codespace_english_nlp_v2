{'text': 'O you who believe! Do not render in vain your Sadaqah (charity) by reminders of your generosity or by injury, like him who spends his wealth to be seen of men, and he does not believe in Allah, nor in the Last Day. His likeness is the likeness of a smooth rock on which is a little dust; on it falls heavy rain which leaves it bare. They are not able to do anything with what they have earned. And Allah does not guide the disbelieving people.', 'meta': {'translator': 'Dr Mohsin Khan', 'surah_id': 2, 'ayah_no': 264, 'surah_name_en': 'Al-Baqara (The Cow)', 'surah_name_ar': 'البقرۃ'}}
