{'text': 'O you who believe! Enter not the Prophets houses, except when leave is given to you for a meal, (and then) not (so early as) to wait for its preparation. But when you are invited, enter, and when you have taken your meal, disperse, without sitting for a talk. Verily, such (behaviour) annoys the Prophet, and he is shy of (asking) you (to go), but Allah is not shy of (telling you) the truth. And when you ask (his wives) for anything you want, ask them from behind a screen, that is purer for your hearts and for their hearts. And it is not (right) for you that you should annoy Allahs Messenger, nor that you should ever marry his wives after him (his death). Verily! With Allah that shall be an enormity.', 'meta': {'translator': 'Dr Mohsin Khan', 'surah_id': 33, 'ayah_no': 53, 'surah_name_en': 'Al-Ahzab (The Coalition)', 'surah_name_ar': 'الاحزاب'}}
