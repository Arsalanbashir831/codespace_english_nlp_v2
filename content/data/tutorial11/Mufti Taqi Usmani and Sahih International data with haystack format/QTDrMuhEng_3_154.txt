Slumber overtook a party of you, while another party was thinking about themselves (as how to save their ownselves, ignoring the others and the Prophet SAW) and thought wrongly of Allah - the thought of ignorance.

Say: "Even if you had remained in your homes, those for whom death was decreed would certainly have gone forth to the place of their death," but that Allah might test what is in your breasts; and to Mahis that which was in your hearts (sins), and Allah is AllKnower of what is in (your) breasts.', 'meta': {'translator': 'Dr Mohsin Khan', 'surah_id': 3, 'ayah_no': 154, 'surah_name_en': 'Aal-e-Imran (The family of Imran)', 'surah_name_ar': 'آل عمران'}}
