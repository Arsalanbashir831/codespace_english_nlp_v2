Be not like those who disbelieve (hypocrites) and who say to their brethren when they travel through the earth or go out to fight: "If they had stayed with us, they would not have died or been killed," so that Allah may make it a cause of regret in their hearts. It is Allah that gives life and causes death. And Allah is AllSeer of what you do.', 'meta': {'translator': 'Dr Mohsin Khan', 'surah_id': 3, 'ayah_no': 156, 'surah_name_en': 'Aal-e-Imran (The family of Imran)', 'surah_name_ar': 'آل عمران'}}
