{'text': 'They ask you for a legal verdict. Say: "Allah directs (thus) about AlKalalah (those who leave neither descendants nor ascendants as heirs). If it is a man that dies, leaving a sister, but no child, she shall have half the inheritance. If (such a deceased was) a woman, who left no child, her brother takes her inheritance. If there are two sisters, they shall have two-thirds of the inheritance; if there are brothers and sisters, the male will have twice the share of the female. (Thus) does Allah makes clear to you (His Law) lest you go astray. And Allah is the All-Knower of everything."', 'meta': {'translator': 'Dr Mohsin Khan', 'surah_id': 4, 'ayah_no': 176, 'surah_name_en': 'An-Nisa (The woman)', 'surah_name_ar': 'النسآء'}}
