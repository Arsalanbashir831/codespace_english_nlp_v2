{'text': 'Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allah has made one of them to excel the other, and because they spend (to support them) from their means. Therefore the righteous women are devoutly obedient (to Allah and to their husbands), and guard in the husbands absence what Allah orders them to guard (e.g. their chastity, their husbands property, etc.). As to those women on whose part you see illconduct, admonish them (first), (next), refuse to share their beds, (and last) beat them (lightly, if it is useful), but if they return to obedience, seek not against them means (of annoyance). Surely, Allah is Ever Most High, Most Great.', 'meta': {'translator': 'Dr Mohsin Khan', 'surah_id': 4, 'ayah_no': 34, 'surah_name_en': 'An-Nisa (The woman)', 'surah_name_ar': 'النسآء'}}
