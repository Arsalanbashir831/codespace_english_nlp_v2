{'text': 'O you who believe! Approach not AsSalat (the prayer) when you are in a drunken state until you know (the meaning) of what you utter, nor when you are in a state of Janaba, (i.e. in a state of sexual impurity and have not yet taken a bath) except when travelling on the road (without enough water, or just passing through a mosque), till you wash your whole body. And if you are ill, or on a journey, or one of you comes after answering the call of nature, or you have been in contact with women (by sexual relations) and you find no water, perform Tayammum with clean earth and rub therewith your faces and hands (Tayammum). Truly, Allah is Ever OftPardoning, OftForgiving.', 'meta': {'translator': 'Dr Mohsin Khan', 'surah_id': 4, 'ayah_no': 43, 'surah_name_en': 'An-Nisa (The woman)', 'surah_name_ar': 'النسآء'}}
