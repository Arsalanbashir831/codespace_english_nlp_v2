But the Monasticism which they invented for themselves, We did not prescribe for them, but (they sought it) only to please Allah therewith, but that they did not observe it with the right observance. So We gave those among them who believed, their (due) reward, but many of them are Fasiqoon (rebellious, disobedient to Allah).', 'meta': {'translator': 'Dr Mohsin Khan', 'surah_id': 57, 'ayah_no': 27, 'surah_name_en': 'Al-Hadid (The Iron)', 'surah_name_ar': 'الحدید'}}
