{'text': 'O you who believe! Violate not the sanctity of the Symbols of Allah, nor of the Sacred Month, nor of the animals brought for sacrifice, nor the garlanded people or animals, etc. (Marked by the garlands on their necks made from the outer part of the treestems (of Makkah) for their security), nor the people coming to the Sacred House (Makkah), seeking the bounty and good pleasure of their Lord. But when you finish the Ihram (of Hajj or Umrah), you may hunt, and let not the hatred of some people in (once) stopping you from AlMasjidalHaram (at Makkah) lead you to transgression (and hostility on your part). Help you one another in AlBirr and AtTaqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression. And fear Allah. Verily, Allah is Severe in punishment.', 'meta': {'translator': 'Dr Mohsin Khan', 'surah_id': 5, 'ayah_no': 2, 'surah_name_en': 'Al-Meada (The Table Spread)', 'surah_name_ar': 'المآئدۃ'}}
