{'text': 'The Jews say: "Allahs Hand is tied up (i.e. He does not give and spend of His Bounty)." Be their hands tied up and be they accursed for what they uttered. Nay, both His Hands are widely outstretched. He spends (of His Bounty) as He wills. Verily, the Revelation that has come to you from Allah increases in most of them their obstinate rebellion and disbelief. We have put enmity and hatred amongst them till the Day of Resurrection. Every time they kindled the fire of war, Allah extinguished it; and they (ever) strive to make mischief on earth. And Allah does not like the Mufsidoon (mischiefmakers).', 'meta': {'translator': 'Dr Mohsin Khan', 'surah_id': 5, 'ayah_no': 64, 'surah_name_en': 'Al-Meada (The Table Spread)', 'surah_name_ar': 'المآئدۃ'}}
