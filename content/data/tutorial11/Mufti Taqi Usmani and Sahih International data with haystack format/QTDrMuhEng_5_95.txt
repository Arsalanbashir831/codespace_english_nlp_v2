{'text': 'O you who believe! Kill not game while you are in a state of Ihram for Hajj or Umrah (pilgrimage), and whosoever of you kills it intentionally, the penalty is an offering, brought to the Kabah, of an eatable animal (i.e. sheep, goat, cow, etc.) equivalent to the one he killed, as adjudged by two just men among you; or, for expiation, he should feed Masakin (poor persons), or its equivalent in Saum (fasting), that he may taste the heaviness (punishment) of his deed. Allah has forgiven what is past, but whosoever commits it again, Allah will take retribution from him. And Allah is AllMighty, All-Able of Retribution.', 'meta': {'translator': 'Dr Mohsin Khan', 'surah_id': 5, 'ayah_no': 95, 'surah_name_en': 'Al-Meada (The Table Spread)', 'surah_name_ar': 'المآئدۃ'}}
