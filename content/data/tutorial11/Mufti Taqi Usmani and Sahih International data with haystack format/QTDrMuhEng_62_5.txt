{'text': 'The likeness of those who were entrusted with the (obligation of the) Taurat (Torah) (i.e. to obey its commandments and to practise its legal laws), but who subsequently failed in those (obligations), is as the likeness of a donkey who carries huge burdens of books (but understands nothing from them). How bad is the example (or the likeness) of people who deny the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, signs, revelations, etc.) of Allah. And Allah guides not the people who are Zalimoon (polytheists, wrong-doers, disbelievers, etc.).', 'meta': {'translator': 'Dr Mohsin Khan', 'surah_id': 62, 'ayah_no': 5, 'surah_name_en': 'Al-Jumua (The congregation, Friday)', 'surah_name_ar': 'الجُمعۃ'}}
