{'text': 'O Prophet (SAW)! When you divorce women, divorce them at their Iddah (prescribed periods), and count (accurately) their Iddah (periods ). And fear Allah your Lord (O Muslims), and turn them not out of their (husbands) homes, nor shall they (themselves) leave, except in case they are guilty of some open illegal sexual intercourse. And those are the set limits of Allah. And whosoever transgresses the set limits of Allah, then indeed he has wronged himself. You (the one who divorces his wife) know not, it may be that Allah will afterward bring some new thing to pass (i.e. to return her back to you if that was the first or second divorce).', 'meta': {'translator': 'Dr Mohsin Khan', 'surah_id': 65, 'ayah_no': 1, 'surah_name_en': 'At-Talaq (Divorce)', 'surah_name_ar': 'الطّلاق'}}
