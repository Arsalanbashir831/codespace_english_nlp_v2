And whosoever believes in Allah and performs righteous good deeds, He will admit him into Gardens under which rivers flow (Paradise), to dwell therein forever. Allah has indeed granted for him an excellent provision.', 'meta': {'translator': 'Dr Mohsin Khan', 'surah_id': 65, 'ayah_no': 11, 'surah_name_en': 'At-Talaq (Divorce)', 'surah_name_ar': 'الطّلاق'}}
