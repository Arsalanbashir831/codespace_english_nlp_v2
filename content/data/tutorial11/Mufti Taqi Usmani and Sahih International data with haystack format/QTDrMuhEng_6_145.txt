{'text': 'Say (O Muhammad SAW): "I find not in that which has been inspired to me anything forbidden to be eaten by one who wishes to eat it, unless it be Maytatah (a dead animal) or blood poured forth (by slaughtering or the like), or the flesh of swine (pork, etc.) for that surely is impure, or impious (unlawful) meat (of an animal) which is slaughtered as a sacrifice for others than Allah (or has been slaughtered for idols, etc., or on which Allahs Name has not been mentioned while slaughtering). But whosoever is forced by necessity without wilful disobedience, nor transgressing due limits, (for him) certainly, your Lord is OftForgiving, Most Merciful."', 'meta': {'translator': 'Dr Mohsin Khan', 'surah_id': 6, 'ayah_no': 145, 'surah_name_en': 'Al-Anaam (The cattle)', 'surah_name_ar': 'الانعام'}}
