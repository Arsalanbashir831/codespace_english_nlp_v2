{'text': 'Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Come, I will recite what your Lord has prohibited you from: Join not anything in worship with Him; be good and dutiful to your parents; kill not your children because of poverty - We provide sustenance for you and for them; come not near to Al-Fawahish (shameful sins, illegal sexual intercourse, etc.) whether committed openly or secretly, and kill not anyone whom Allah has forbidden, except for a just cause (according to Islamic law). This He has commanded you that you may understand.', 'meta': {'translator': 'Dr Mohsin Khan', 'surah_id': 6, 'ayah_no': 151, 'surah_name_en': 'Al-Anaam (The cattle)', 'surah_name_ar': 'الانعام'}}
