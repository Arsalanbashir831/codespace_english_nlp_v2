{'text': 'It is He Who sends down water (rain) from the sky, and with it We bring forth vegetation of all kinds, and out of it We bring forth green stalks, from which We bring forth thick clustered grain. And out of the datepalm and its spathe come forth clusters of dates hanging low and near, and gardens of grapes, olives and pomegranates, each similar (in kind) yet different (in variety and taste). Look at their fruits when they begin to bear, and the ripeness thereof. Verily! In these things there are signs for people who believe.', 'meta': {'translator': 'Dr Mohsin Khan', 'surah_id': 6, 'ayah_no': 99, 'surah_name_en': 'Al-Anaam (The cattle)', 'surah_name_ar': 'الانعام'}}
