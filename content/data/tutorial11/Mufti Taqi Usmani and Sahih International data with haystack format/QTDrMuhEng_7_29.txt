{'text': 'Say (O Muhammad SAW): My Lord has commanded justice and (said) that you should face Him only (i.e. worship none but Allah and face the Qiblah, i.e. the Kabah at Makkah during prayers) in each and every place of worship, in prayers (and not to face other false deities and idols), and invoke Him only making your religion sincere to Him by not joining in worship any partner to Him and with the intention that you are doing your deeds for Allahs sake only. As He brought you (into being) in the beginning, so shall you be brought into being (on the Day of Resurrection) (in two groups, one as a blessed one (believers), and the other as a wretched one (disbelievers)).', 'meta': {'translator': 'Dr Mohsin Khan', 'surah_id': 7, 'ayah_no': 29, 'surah_name_en': 'Al-Araf (The heights)', 'surah_name_ar': 'الاعراف'}}
