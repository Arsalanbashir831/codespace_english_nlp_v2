That is because they suffer neither thirst nor fatigue, nor hunger in the Cause of Allah, nor they take any step to raise the anger of disbelievers nor inflict any injury upon an enemy but is written to their credit as a deed of righteousness. Surely, Allah wastes not the reward of the Muhsinoon', 'meta': {'translator': 'Dr Mohsin Khan', 'surah_id': 9, 'ayah_no': 120, 'surah_name_en': 'At-Taubah (Repentance)', 'surah_name_ar': 'التوبۃ'}}
