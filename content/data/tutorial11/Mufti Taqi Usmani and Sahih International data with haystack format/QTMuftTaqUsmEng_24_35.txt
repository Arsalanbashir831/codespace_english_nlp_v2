{'text': 'Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth. The example of His light is that of a niche, in which there is a lamp; the lamp is in a glass - the glass looks like a brilliant star - it is lit by (the oil of) a blessed tree, the olive, which is neither eastern, nor western. Its oil is about to emit light even though the fire has not touched it - (it is) light upon light. Allah guides to His light whomsoever He wills; Allah describes examples for the people, and Allah knows everything well.', 'meta': {'translator': 'Mufti Taqi Usmani', 'surah_id': 24, 'ayah_no': 35, 'surah_name_en': 'An-Noor (The Light)', 'surah_name_ar': 'النور'}}
