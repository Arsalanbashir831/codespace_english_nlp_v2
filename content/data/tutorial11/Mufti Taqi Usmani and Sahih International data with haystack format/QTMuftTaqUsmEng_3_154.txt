{'text': 'Then, after the grief, He poured tranquility upon you - a drowsiness overtaking a group of you. Another group was worrying about their own selves, harboring thoughts about Allah that were untrue - thoughts of ignorance. They were saying, “Is there anything in our hands?” Say, “The whole thing belongs to Allah.” They conceal in their hearts what they do not disclose to you.They say, “If we had any say in the matter, we would not have been killed here.”Say, “If you were in your homes, those destined to be killed would have come out all the way to their (final) resting -places.” (All this was done) so that Allah may test your inner qualities and may purify what is in your hearts. Allah is All-Aware of what lies in the hearts.', 'meta': {'translator': 'Mufti Taqi Usmani', 'surah_id': 3, 'ayah_no': 154, 'surah_name_en': 'Aal-e-Imran (The family of Imran)', 'surah_name_ar': 'آل عمران'}}
