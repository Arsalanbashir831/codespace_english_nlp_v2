{'text': 'Allah has made the Children of Israel take a pledge. We appointed twelve chiefs from among them. Allah said, “I am surely with you. If you establish Salāh, and pay Zakāh, and believe in My Messengers, and hold them in reverence, and advance to Allah a goodly loan, I shall certainly write off your evil deeds, and I shall certainly admit you into Gardens beneath which rivers flow. So, whoever from you disbelieves after that has lost the straight path.”', 'meta': {'translator': 'Mufti Taqi Usmani', 'surah_id': 5, 'ayah_no': 12, 'surah_name_en': 'Al-Meada (The Table Spread)', 'surah_name_ar': 'المآئدۃ'}}
