{'text': 'O prophet, when you people divorce women, divorce them at a time when the period of ‘Iddah may start. And count the period of ‘Iddah, and fear Allah, your Lord. Do not expel them from their houses, nor should they go out, unless they come up with a clearly shameless act. These are the limits prescribed by Allah. And whoever exceeds the limits prescribed by Allah wrongs his own self. You do not know (what will happen in future); it may be that Allah brings about a new situation thereafter.', 'meta': {'translator': 'Mufti Taqi Usmani', 'surah_id': 65, 'ayah_no': 1, 'surah_name_en': 'At-Talaq (Divorce)', 'surah_name_ar': 'الطّلاق'}}
