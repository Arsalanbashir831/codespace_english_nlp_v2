{'text': 'Avoid those who have taken their faith as fun and games. The worldly life has deceived them. Preach with it (the Qur’ān), lest one should be seized for what he did, in a way that he should have neither a helper besides Allah, nor an intercessor. Should he offer every (sort of) ransom, it will not be accepted from him. Those are the ones who are seized for what they themselves earned. For them there is a drink of boiling water, and a painful punishment, because they used to disbelieve.', 'meta': {'translator': 'Mufti Taqi Usmani', 'surah_id': 6, 'ayah_no': 70, 'surah_name_en': 'Al-Anaam (The cattle)', 'surah_name_ar': 'الانعام'}}
