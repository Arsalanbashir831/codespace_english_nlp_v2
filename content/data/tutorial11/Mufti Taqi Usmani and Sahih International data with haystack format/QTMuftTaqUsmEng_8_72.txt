{'text': 'Surely those who believed and emigrated and carried out Jihād in the way of Allah with their wealth and lives, and those who gave refuge and help (to the emigrants), both are close friends to each other. And those who believed and did not emigrate, you have no friendship with them at all, unless they emigrate. However, if they seek your help in the matter of faith, then, you are bound to help, except against a people with whom you have a treaty. Allah is watchful over what you do.', 'meta': {'translator': 'Mufti Taqi Usmani', 'surah_id': 8, 'ayah_no': 72, 'surah_name_en': 'Al-Anfal (Spoils of war, booty)', 'surah_name_ar': 'الانفال'}}
