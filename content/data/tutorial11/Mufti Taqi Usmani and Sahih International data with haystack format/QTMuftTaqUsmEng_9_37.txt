{'text': 'Nasī’ (i.e. postponement of months) is nothing but a further excess in infidelity, whereby the disbelievers are misguided. They allow it one year and disallow it another year, so that they may conform (only) to the number of what Allah has sanctified, and allow what Allah has disallowed. The evil of their deeds has been beautified for them (by Satan). And Allah does not lead the disbelieving people to the right path.', 'meta': {'translator': 'Mufti Taqi Usmani', 'surah_id': 9, 'ayah_no': 37, 'surah_name_en': 'At-Taubah (Repentance)', 'surah_name_ar': 'التوبۃ'}}
